This project was made with React, Create React App, and this helpful reference, which I liberally copied from (it's most of the code, by volume, so to speak).

## Comments

I wanted to make the simplest possible Quiz app using React that you could make. I wasn't able to find a simpler one than this - so I made it.

You can run and edit here on Glitch, or clone it from GitHub, run yarn install and yarn start, and then deploy to AWS Amplify (though lol, who would do that for this).

### Improvements

I could definitely have made the intro and outro screens snazzier.

You'll notice there's a whole state variable - correct - I'm not even using. You could.

Most obviously, you can edit the questions to make your own quiz, or pick superior gifs.
